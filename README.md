# RGB and LCH colour models with JS 

## Intro: 
RGB and LCH colour models created for a controlled within-participants color picking experiment. 
Made with the desire to minimize the differences between the models, for a more accurate result of our expression.

## Usage:
1. Open the HTML file in a web browser or go to https://www.natee.no/code/colour/index.html
3. Two color pickers are provided: RGB Color Picker and LCH Color Picker.
4. Each color picker has sliders for its respective color model parameters:
   **RGB Color Picker:**
    Red (R)
    Green (G)
    Blue (B)
  **LCH Color Picker:**
    Lightness (L)
    Chroma (C)
    Hue (H)
5. Move the sliders to adjust the values for each color component.
The real-time color representation is displayed, as well as the the numeric values of the sliders.
